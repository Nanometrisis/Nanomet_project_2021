Use a FORTRAN compiler to run this program
The executable "aniso.x" is ready to use by typing "./aniso.x" in the command window
To change the input parameters use "anisolayer.in" (read also the deliverable's document)
To compile the program type the command "make" (it is used only if you have
changed the source code - if you only change the inputfile you do not need it)
The output file is "fort.21" (read also the deliverable's document)
